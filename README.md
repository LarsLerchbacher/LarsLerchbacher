Hi! I'm Lars, a hobby programmer and student at a higher technical college.

I hope that my projects will be useful for anybody at some time.

GPG Keys
---

I'll try to keep all my used GPG public keys in the KEYS.md file in this repo.
If one is missing, but shown as verified, please contact me, so I can add the missing key (I tend to forget stuff).
